        <Name>Steak Fajitas</Name>
        <Picture>steakFajitas.jpg</Picture>
        <Ingredients>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 lb of flank steak, skirt steak or carne asada</li>
                <li>1 large yellow onion, peeled and sliced with the grain, not against the grain as one would normally slice an onion. Slice first in half, and then slice off sections a half inch wide at widest point.</li>
                <li>2-3 bell peppers of various colors, stemmed, seeded, de-ribbed, sliced lengthwise into strips</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>			
        </Ingredients>
        <Directions>1. Set a large cast iron pan or griddle over high heat and let this heat up for 1-2 minutes. Add the tablespoon of oil to the pan and let this heat up for 1 minute. Add the steak, frying on each side for 3 minutes, or to desired doneness. 3 minutes per side will yield approximately medium rare doneness for an average cut of flank steak. Then remove from pan and let sit, tented with foil, for 5 minutes.<br/>2. Cook the vegetables while the meat is resting. Add a little more oil to the pan if necessary, then add the onions and bell peppers. Let these sear for 1 minute before stirring, then stir every 90 seconds or so as the veggies sear. Cook for 5-6 minutes total.<br/>3. Slice the meat across the grain into thin slices. If you slice the meat at an angle, you will be able to get your slices pretty thin. These cuts of steak are flavorful but can be a little tough, so thin slices will really help make it easier to eat.<br/>4. Serve immediately with shredded cheese, salsa, shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and warm flour tortillas. (Hint for warming tortillas - put in microwave over a paper towel for 20 seconds on high heat.)</Directions>

                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>4 (3/4-inch-thick) boneless pork chops (about 1 3/4 pounds total)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed</li>
                <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>

        </Ingredients>
        <Directions>Heat the oil and butter in a large cast iron skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat until very hot and almost smoking. Meanwhile, pat the pork chops dry with paper towels. Generously season all over with the salt and pepper. Add the pork to the pan and sear until golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side (the pork chops will not be cooked through). Transfer to a large plate. Add the mushrooms to the pan and cook, stirring every few minutes, until browned and softened, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken broth and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Return the pork chops and any accumulated juices to the pan, nestling them in the mushrooms. Cover and simmer until the pork chops are cooked through and register 145Â°F on an instant-read thermometer, 7 to 9 minutes more. Remove from the heat. Stir in the mustard and cream. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed.</Directions>

        <Ingredients>
            <ul>
                <li>1 4-lb. skinless, boneless pork shoulder (Boston butt), cut into 1â2" pieces</li>
                <li>30 grams kosher salt*</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fennel seeds, toasted</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to tasted</li>
                <li>1 freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>	
                <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons finely grated garlic</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons dry red wine</li>
                <li>3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons drained capers</li>
                <li>2 29â32-mm-diameter natural hog casings, preferably pretubed or preloaded</li>
            </ul>
        </Ingredients>
        <Directions>Chill all grinder parts, including die with Â¼" holes, in freezer until very cold, about 1 hour. Chill a large stainless-steel bowl in refrigerator until cold. Place pork in a single layer on 2 plastic wrapâlined baking sheets; cover and freeze until meat is very firm but not frozen, about 1 hour. Combine salt, fennel seeds, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl; set aside. Grind pork on high speed, 3â4 pieces at a time, into chilled bowl (keep second baking sheet in freezer until ready to use). If grinder clogs (meat will look pink, not red and white), clean die and cutter before continuing. Add garlic and mix gently with your hands just to begin to distribute, about 20 seconds. Sprinkle reserved spice mixture evenly over pork and knead, rotating bowl, until spice mixture is evenly distributed and a light film has formed on the side of the bowl, about 1 minute. Add wine; knead until mixture holds together and is very stiff (it will spring back when pressed), about 1 minute. (Donât overmix or sausage will be crumbly.) Form Â¼ cup sausage mixture into a 3"-diameter patty; press into palm. Extend hand with meat, palm facing down. If meat sticks for at least 5 seconds, it is sufficiently mixed. If not, continue to knead in 15-second intervals until it passes the palm test. Wrap patty in a small sheet of foil to form a flat packet. Cover and chill remaining mixture. Cook foil-wrapped patty in a small skillet (not nonstick) over medium-low heat until meat is cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Let rest 2 minutes. Unwrap patty and cut in half; it should hold together. If not, save for another useâlike pasta sauce!âand try again. Place casings in a large bowl under cold running water and let sit, allowing water to overflow and flushing water through casings (take care not to tangle!) until softened, about 2 minutes. Slide 1 casing onto stuffer nozzle, leaving a 6" overhang (do not tie). If casing is too long or tangles, cut in half and work with 1 piece at a time. Pack a handful of sausage mixture very lightly into stuffer. Working with a partner and with stuffer on high speed, use plunger to push meat through, gradually filling casing; gently slide filled casing off nozzle onto a baking sheet as you go. Fill casing firmly but donât overstuff (mixture will tighten when links are twisted, and overfilled casings will burst when cooked). As casing fills, lightly prick air bubbles with sausage pricker. Leave at least 6" of empty casing at the end. Repeat with remaining casing and sausage mixture. Tie off 1 end of casing, making knot flush with meat. Starting 6" from knot, pinch off a 6" length, squeezing on both sides. Twist link toward you 2 rotations. Starting 6" from link, pinch off another 6" length, squeezing on both sides, and twist link away from you 2 rotations. Repeat, alternating direction of twists, until you canât make another 6" sausage. Squeeze out extra meat; tie off casing.

        <Directions>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.

        <Ingredients>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
        </Ingredients>
        <Directions>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and brown sugar in the water, and let sit for 10 minutes. Stir the salt and oil into the yeast solution. Mix in 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Turn dough out onto a clean, well floured surface, and knead in more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. Place the dough into a well oiled bowl, and cover with a cloth. Let the dough rise until double; this should take about 1 hour. Punch down the dough, and form a tight ball. Allow the dough to relax for a minute before rolling out. Use for your favorite pizza recipe. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). If you are baking the dough on a pizza stone, you may place your toppings on the dough, and bake immediately. If you are baking your pizza in a pan, lightly oil the pan, and let the dough rise for 15 or 20 minutes before topping and baking it. Bake pizza in preheated oven, until the cheese and crust are golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.
